Hi guys!

I've included 2 packages. the 'It works one' is with all 3 options available, the 'only one' is with what I managed to do today, meaning i figured out how to use the behaviour tree to allow us to still instantiate at runtime. Please have a look in the behaviour tree (rain->behaviour->behaviourTree->test_noInit).

also, most of the assignments i am doing are additions to Emilia's gui script (attached to the plane object) and in script test_prefabScript.

there is also a small problem with the camera, if it moves, the plane moves, but the objects on the plane don't. we can get to this later on...

if there are any other problems, let me know :)
